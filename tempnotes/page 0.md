The Holographers' Guild knows its number, and its weapon: 7. Precision and articulation give the holographer insight into archetypal landscapes which slice laterally across categories as intuited by the intellect. Aided by rhizomes, allegorixal circumstanzas and retrograde transmitters, the Holographer is abducted by reasoning into vistas unexpected to anyone. The CATS we see everywhere are actually Holographers, on errand, when they automatically and subconsciously take CAT form and stop time. The CAT network comprises many nodes, and those nodes which meow will meow until another CAT arrives, whereupon meowing will cease. M.E.O.W is also an acronym.

protocols are self-describing and self-discovering, they are the holocratic cybernetic stigmergic coalescent decentralized laterally distributed p2p authored self-government of the network

so to make this more than a meme it has to be a study

why would we craft differet rules for this kind of protocol game, and what memes would we engineer and try to spread?

making this practices formalizes it as the presentation of one's values as a small collection of initial topics one might raise with another person—in an activist context or, what other contexts would we want to include?

Writing protocols

The HG is really the core or shepherd guild of the TEAM

 

Anders Celadon, \[02.09.16 21:32\]

The TEAM may actually dissolve and become a network of guilds, and the HG guild will become the mercurial messenger guild that keeps them all networked together, the network technician guild, running errands of information lines back and forth to keep the whole network running smoothly, without a center

 

Anders Celadon, \[02.09.16 21:32\]

It is sort of then a privileged guild, but kinda non-authoritarian because anyone can join it and help write the Protocols

 

Anders Celadon, \[02.09.16 21:33\]

There is a non-method to writing the Protocols—anyone who can do it can teach you the method if you think you don't know it, and have the patience to follow the instructions given by a HG teacher

 

Anders Celadon, \[02.09.16 21:33\]

Or you can just try writing protocols and being inspired to do so, and you will discover the method

 

Anders Celadon, \[02.09.16 21:34\]

Anyone who tries and experiences trying to write the Protocols begins to see it, but most never try

 

Anders Celadon, \[02.09.16 21:35\]

We are trying to capture some of the methods and insight perspectives that go into writing protocols as meta-protocols or metacols, but it is very hard and tricky to do until we have a robust community of holographers producing many converstions about protocol discover/codification

 

Anders Celadon, \[02.09.16 21:36\]

The top priority right now are rolling out the check-ins system, so if you want to help with that that would be very helpful

 

Anders Celadon, \[02.09.16 21:36\]

And rewriting the protocols to v0.4 as a trading card game

 

Anders Celadon, \[02.09.16 21:37\]

Also organizing the onenote notebooks better and increasing guild activity. Writing protocols for guild formation would help with that

 

Anders Celadon, \[02.09.16 21:37\]

But it requires observation or participation in forming guilds to see how it works in praftice
