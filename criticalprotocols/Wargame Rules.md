flagging them forces them to respond publically, or the tag will linger on their account indefinitely

any card can be used to counter any other card, as long as the parties present agree that it is a valid counter, with ties going to the defender

but, using a card to counter something links it forever with the card it was used to counter

so, it is best to just make up a unique new throwaway card to counter things—i.e., your brief rebuttal or denial of the point

 

so it's a game of labeling others and countering labels, so that there are actual conversations about complex identity schemas, identity politics, and shared or conentious relations between these different identity-tags
