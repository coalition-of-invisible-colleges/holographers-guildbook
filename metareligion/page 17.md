**Power couple with violence-hungry redhead aspect**

Mr. and Mrs. Smith

Knight & Day (subtle illuminati tropes instead of overt) (and then Eyes Wide Shut)

Lucy (redhead goddess trope) (Avengers, Resident Evil etc.)

 

**Inequality aspect**

In Time (and Elysium)

 

All of these plug into a conspiracy of a quirkily high-powered couple with an insatiable, eroticized thirst for casual violence who often find themselves battling a system of inequality.
