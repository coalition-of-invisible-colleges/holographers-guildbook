Grown out of /r/sorceryofthespectacle, /r/sotsmeme, and /r/sotsexperimentaltvtm, a new open-source religion is beginning to piece itself together, like some macabre assemblage of some hideous Frankensteinein visage.

 

Synchroccultism attempts to provide a high-quality and "objective" magical education by using cultural artifacts to provide extremely rich illustrations of contemporary mythos.

 

Similar to the Church of the SubGenius's gnosis-inducing "media barrages", our materials strive to be both more deeply educative (in the case of the illuminati mythos cluster-packs) and more efficient (in the case of brief gnosis videos or mashups).

watching several from a cluster keys you into the secrets of that cluster in the illuminati landscape

after you glean 2-5 clusters you start to see that it is a mythic landscape and not to be taken literally

like naive conspiracy theorists do

so it's a path from conspiracy or paranoia or superficial story-reading to more complex and nuanced interpretation of media and awareness of the meta-mythic landscape

 

Anders raisondecalcul, \[18.04.16 14:55\]

it's a more advanced version of Church of the SubGenius

 

Anders raisondecalcul, \[18.04.16 14:55\]

for contemporary attention spans and contemporary conspiracy mythmappers

the Church of the SubGenius has "media barrages" but we need to make a science of detournement of media into gnostic video bites

 

letting yourself understand it is not such a big step away from understanding it, since the understanding is latent in all of our myths and stories that we grew up with already
