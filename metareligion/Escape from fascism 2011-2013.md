This flush of movies seems to be concerned with portraying this exact escape from fascism into fantasy and perfection in the most literal and profane way possible. Good movies in this grouping will be uplifting and deconstruct this myth by involving the viewer with cinematic self-reflexivity (exploration of cinema as a theme in the movie, which invites the audience into the secret myth). Bad movies in this grouping will anaesthetize the viewer and promote the myth, without creating any emotional response.
