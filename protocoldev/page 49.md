Ooo i just discovered the Antiprotocols. The unspoken protocols of the TEAM, with a primarily anti-protocol, anti-structure, anti-codification thrust. The Protocols of the TEAM are always just an outdated reflection of the true Antiprotocols, the source of the transcendent wisdom. The antiprotocols do develop, and they leave behind the Protocols as a written record of where they have evolved from, like a shed skin

 

"When you actually codify an Antiprotocol as a Protocol, that immediately begins the process of the deprecation of that Antiprotocol, and the Antiprotocol will change simply by having been spoken. And so it will begin to upgrade itself. And now I've spoken just, **​\*that\*​**, so it's going to be upgrading to a sort of auto-intelligence increasing Anti-protocol-Antiprotocol Protocol Protocol
