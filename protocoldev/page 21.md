Before you do anything, make sure you are using the most recent protocol updates.

 

New or updated pages will be bolded in the desktop version of OneNote, and on the page you will be able to see who authored changes.

 

Please always do check-ins with the protocol stack in front of you if at all possible. This ensures that you don’t skip anything and that an updates will be propagated.

 

Because of the stigmergic nature of the TEAM and the protocol-creation process, by the time you have a complaint about the protocols, it is likely it has already been corrected and the change rolled out into the written protocols in this \#stack. This is because the Holographer's Guild, made up of those who channel, construct, and scribe the Protocols, make their headquarters in the near future.
