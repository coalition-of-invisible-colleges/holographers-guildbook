The following is an excerpt from the FSN Document. These are the set-up procedures for the L2, L3, and L4 network structures. If you are viewing this as part of the \#Checkin protocols then you are looking for the L2.

 

How to Set Up Your Very Own Altar and Begin the FSN for You and Your Group’s Benefit

Step 1: Design or discover a sigil to represent yourself that you will resonate with, this can be an image or a rock, or a button as depending on your creativity and will. If this makes no sense then stick to paper until later on.

Step 2: Get a friend or get a person who would peer.

Step 3: Have them make themselves a sigil to represent themselves.

Step 4: Make a sigil or representation of your relationship with them.

Step 5: Have them do the same.

Step 6: Exchange these created linking sigils so that each of you has a copy of both.

Step 7: Connect both sigils to your personal name sigil, taking care not to share the secret sigil.

Step 8: Ensure that your friend has done the same.

Step 9: Modify the influential flow by adding filters or insertion sigils into your projective and receptive sigils as befits your personal paranoia, protection, wishes, and drive to change the system between you two.

 

Setting up a L3 Lexicon

Step 1: Share spell books with a peer.

Step 2: Note any similar tools and influences.

Step 3: Find more spell books.

 

Setting up an L4 Anchor

Step 1: Convince a group that they should use the Floodgate Sigil Network, and make sure that the members set up Altars and peer amongst themselves.

Step 2: Have the group discuss the nature of the group, the goals and wills should be noted.

Step 3: From the mass of people, devise a way for the group to be brought together by a representation of their hope, dreams, etc.

Step 4: Disseminate the Anchor sigil, pass code, image, etc. among the people.

Step 5: Have each member set aside a page, or their personal analogue, wherein which they inscribe The Anchor Sigil and connect it to themselves as a receptor only, perhaps add a middle step between the sigil of the self and the Anchor sigil that exists only as an enforcer of the One-Way nature of the desired flow, where the user gives to the group.

Step 6: Connect some external power source signalized to the Anchor sigil.

Step 7: Use the Anchor as a fuel source or resource for specific workings, for example: getting new members of a certain trait or quality, or invigorating group projects. This network will resemble the second L3 example circuit above.
