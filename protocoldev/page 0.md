The primary project/role of the Holographers' Guild is the development/discovery of the Protocols of the TEAM. These protocols are holographic, stigmergic, transcendent, and self-describing, and so they can be "discovered" by writing them and finding how the edges all coalesce to fit together eerily perfectly and more-than-expected.

 

We create The Protocols to serve liberated individuals who take responsibility for their existence. This different type of awareness manifests as cooperative network behavior, a complete departure from competitive hierarchical domination. The Protocols are specially crafted to allow any individual to take on potentially any role of the system according to demand and ability.

 

Some ideals. Protocol development should proceed according to basic human needs (eg. Food, manufacturing, etc). We write Protocols for open culture which addresses scarcities in a viral and self-sufficient manner, destroying local markets through abundance, and freeing ourselves from the global supply chain.

 

\#rootseal declare any boundary of virtual space as the new reality with regards to the perspective of the observer, so that more general information can be assumed to be within the awareness of all participants, and need not be brought up when speaking naively .
