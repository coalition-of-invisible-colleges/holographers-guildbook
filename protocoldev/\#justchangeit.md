**Purpose:** To remind you that what we are doing is not an authoritarian system and that there are no rules or official versions of documents. Do not go to people whom you are perceiving as an authority to complain about something you think is wrong or badly designed. Instead, **JUST CHANGE IT.**

 

**Prerequisites:** \#readthefuckingprotocol (i.e., first read the entire protocol stack up to you are, if you aren't fully up-to-date, so that your correction will be a well-informed one)

 

1.  If you see something in this notebook which you disagree with, JUST CHANGE IT. Don't find someone to bitch about it to, JUST CHANGE IT.

2.  If you see something misspelled, correct the spelling!

3.  If you see something in the wrong place (maybe it got moved by accident, or the person who created it didn't know there was a place for it), JUST MOVE IT.

4.  **Exception: Don't delete things; instead, move them to the Bullshit Can tab.** Deleting things other people have written is kind of rude, because they might want to save that text.

    a.  Similarly, if you are doing a large rewrite of someone else's text, save a copy of their old version in the Bullshit Can tab.

<!-- -->

1.  **Important: If your change was a big change or might be something that steps on other people's toes, please inform those people that you made the change so that they can react to it.**

    a.  To do otherwise is passive-aggressive and a form of cowardice—your edits were probably motivated by resentment and not inspiration if you are not excited to tell others about your new contributions.
