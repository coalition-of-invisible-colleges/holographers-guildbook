Academy 23 pages

 

Each person has one \#curriculum page. These are currently house under the Academy 23 tab so they are browseable all at once (and because they fit nicely there—\#peoplearenottheirorders), but it might be better to move them to each org's tab.

 

These are pages on which we can recommend and share links to important media, and repeatedly bump up or recommend things to people so they get how important the recommendation is over time ;-). They are great for developing interpersonal relationships and for keeping person-to-person project information and other notes, and also for getting to know others for exploring their mythic worlds and current reading/viewing material.
