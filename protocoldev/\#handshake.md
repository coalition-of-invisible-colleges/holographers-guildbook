Handshake is what happens when two entities meet, and exchange DNA.

 

At the group level, DNA is their glossary, ultimately—the set of words that entity recognizes collectively, and which things those words point to. Protocols are implicitly included in a glossary, especially if those protocols are named.

 

At the individual level, the \#handshake protocol involves playing and discussing this game until a relatively clear idea of the "rules" is formed.

 

**Self-check-in instructions:** Read the above text. Consider what protocols you might like to offer others, as cards that you write.

 

**Upkeep instructions:** Whenever you check in with someone (or play a round of the card game), revisit every card in each of your core stacks in order to make sure that you've both brought each other up-to-date on the most interesting developments in the game.

 

**Interviewer instructions:** Mention the \#handshake protocol.
