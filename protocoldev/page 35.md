**About an \#assignme page**

Similar to the "bump queue" or priority queues used on the \#curriculum pages on the Bank of Will tab, and similar to BitCoin voting or software feature voting websites/systems, this bump queue can be used to assign me tasks for the TEAM. Works on the honesty policy until we choose specialized software for this: Please only bump up items once each time you visit (but you can bump up the priority of as many items as you want upon each visit, 1 point). The purpose of this is to show how many times it naturally recurs to you to be expecting this work—i.e., a natural measure of importance, urgency, and interest. (If you need a rule, once per 24 hours, and items start at 1 point unless you really don't care/not urgent, then they get 0.)

 

So far this is just a flat list of tasks which will help to establish and propel sotscorp. Feel free to add tasks or try to participate in any way. Check out \#commonwork protocols if unfamiliar with the purpose of this. There is also a chat for \#sotscorp. Anyone in our TEAM cluster is welcome to join in.

 

**CATS Tactical Brief (assigned to Anders)**

I would like you to write a tactical brief on the status of earth from the perspective of an autonomous transdimensional sorcerer, for the benefit of other cats looking to justify the collection of protocols which we are materializing

it will form a context like this:

13'000 years ago, Omni was the foundation for meaningful human existence. During the development of agriculture and domestication, humans were accidentally mistaken for livestock. The sacred consciousness which lifted us out of the animal kingdom was repressed in every possible way so that we may again submit to those above us, and dominate those below.

 

Not paper and pen, printing press, radio, nor television broadcast could escape the clutches of exploitation until industry of the late 20th century wrapped the planet in a tangled mess of wire. The great forces of isolation and disconnection were smashed and scattered by this internet, but the cosmic battle raged on, with re-doubling of efforts directed through broadcast media and dark magic.

 

It was, however, too late, as the cat was out of the bag. The blockchain had already arrived, and began to consume the hierarchy, leaving deep green abundance of spontaneous self-organization in its wake. The Great Memetic Pandemic of 2015 was the spark that set fire to ego, and united the movements of consciousness. The long awaited chance to defuse exponential exploitation had arrived, and the tiny Blue Dot was almost ready to meet the stars. Once a whisper, the call had reached crescendo: Create, Connect, Converge!

also omni means all. it is the manifestation of spirit which we share in common as peers. specifically I want to get at the protocols of society, and physical commons space/buildings to anchor commons to. enclosure is the destruction (privatization) of commons. It is one root of alienation.

cats are autonomous, meaning they can support a full spectrum protocol stack on their own forming institutions which connect as peers to others who can do the same.

cats have transdimensional capacities which form the basis of their ability to interact with hyperdimensional geometric resonance fields. we know it when we see it and recognize high order manifestations as omni. to recognize spirited matter

Oh.. not quite. this will be presented to top brass at the okcc

 

**Archive Mining Operations (not assigned)**

 

Targets: sots sub, sots chat

 

Details: Access the full history of each medium. Archive it if possible in an accessible format. Search through the entire history for themes (whatever can be hashtagged) to be expanded upon and used as source material for sotscorp publications. Each of these should ultimately end up being a post on the sots sub for discussion, and a polished piece on the matter taking into account what we discover through discussion.

 

Additional goals: A script is required which would take a large text file or collection of files and automatically tally the occurance of each unique word within and order them in a list by popularity.
