**General information about the profile and hashtag list**

 

The profile is a situational assesment and a tool to help users interact with each other. It acts as a starting point for an individual to collect themselves and begin to integrate with and boost the network. What we are doing here is gathering points of interest on which we can intersect with others. New \#crew brings fresh new perspectives and possibly more detail to the shared hashtag space. A hashtag can be a problem, a solution, a project name, a tactical meme etc. It has the ability to collect others and build wisdom together.

 

 

**Guide for assembling a hashtag list**

 

This section is critical, and perhaps most difficult, because we are building the interface to the teamearth mythoscape, which acts as common medium to connect with others on themes and archtypical grounds, a translation matrix between worlds.

 

The following advice is useful for organizing a lot of material. Gather all your notes, maps, charts, books, movies, quotes, bookmarks, arguments, best reddit posts, etc. Sort away the useless stuff. Meditate on each scrap and see if you can pull wisdom out of it in the form of a hashtag. What is this piece getting at? What is the root of this?

 

At first hashtags can be loosely grouped together and later organized into mind maps for an overview. Some files or scraps or sheets may be found which are very relevant to expanding and developing a hashtag. File away any scraps which are no longer useful, write a hashtag on others to be viewed later under context. Try to focus on obtaining a good core sample of topics. Once all notes are processed meditate on the results and fill in any gaps.

 

There is no strict order to do this, work on what seems most important. Once the mind map has taken shape it may be a good time to start taking some of the most important hashtags and linking them in the realm of teamearth. The starting point is complete, and now the user may begin to express the hashtags as nodes, or interact with existing nodes, expand on branches, its like the plumbing to allows views to be expressed to others.

 

Once the hashtag cloud becomes complex enough, it will also begin to accumulate content sorted according to its archtypical topology. Ideal examples to bolster the ideas behind a node will begin to accumulate there, perhaps an entire community may anchor its efforts to a tag.

 

Real world examples may accumulate, such as recording of radio hosts or commercials or songs or tv shows which exemplify various aspects of cultural mass \#mediaprogramming like \#behavioralshaming. These are just the recognized and recorded encounters of our daily lives so much of it will be negative bile. It may be more difficult but important to bolster the occulted tags, the real good news, with examples such as Decentralized Dance Party or The Liberators International.

 

 

**Transliminet specifications**

 

A magical nexus commons.

 

A collection of decentralized realms in the service of TEAM clusters, and the root signifier.

 

Map.decente.red hosts the Realm of TEAM Earth

 

\#teamearth is not the only realm. Some realms may be more open and collaborative, others may be part of a personal profile and partially private. Each one strengthens and clarifies itself through its connections (translations) to other realms. Creation of the

 

The work of iterating other realms and linking them in to the TEA"Middle Earth" will clarify the common realm, the more links that it has to other ways of expressing the same things. When I make a hashtag called \#permaculture, I expect that it will collide and at least partially merge with other nodes of the same name hosted on other servers.

 

I guess I should lay out the low layer protocols for context. I am using the web server/html medium. The root of the website is just a start page which drops into a couple points within the Realm of TEAM Earth. Hashtags are a flat list of folders on the root of the webserver. Hashtags can have subfolders but they are not global (ie you cant just type the tag into the root of the webserver). Eg. /crew/ contains usernames which contain the profile of the user. The creation of a profile in the realm is part of the initiation. You will be crew, and captain of your own vessel

 

How to actually participate. Each node has a corresponding forum post, so at the very least additions could be suggested there. Even a discussion about the tag is great. You can make your own notes and maps and whatnot and compare notes or do what you like with what is here. Though it will be helpful to bring in a realm of popular mythos, one cannot fully participate in the network without creating a profile with a realm unique to you. I think the relevant information could be contained in a forum post for a realm, but some server space would be required for artistic freedom.

 

Anyone can copy any of my work and do their own (open source). Anyone can start a server and host their own mindmap. Anyone can author whatever tag they want, if people link to it great. Everyone is welcome to create their own realm, either an attempt at translating an existing mythos, or to express the profile. The profile is automatically considered the root of a new realm. Full participation would mean expanding upon this new realm as well as hosting it and linking into existing nodes (hashtags… themes, archtypes, etc) and or creating new ones.

 

**Mindmap**- this is the adapter which plugs into the teamearth mythoscape/memeplex. It is your own picking and choosing of established archtypes and concepts of teamearth (or create and link new ones) which you feel strongly shape your worldview.
