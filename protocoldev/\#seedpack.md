protocol proposal: \#peernet/\#seedpack protocol. Supply material evidence in the form of the seed package for your org showing that it is both virulent and cooperates with itself as a hologram. "How do I do what you do?"

 

this allows the org to plug into the guild I think, filling some piece or role in a generic way as well as specifically by those using it or others

 

maybe another way of thinking about this or going about it is to try to dissolve our various TEAMEO projects into protocols (applications) for the peernet

 

\#dossier is like a linkedin facebook thingy. \#curriculum is the education, transfer of knowledge app.. \#cryptotown is the civil cybernetics app?? etc??

 

 

 

Various elements of our TEAMEO might start to replicate across the TEAM cluster, when pieces are upgraded to global \#protocol status, this I think is where we want the elements to fall along guild lines. our TEAMEO can keep adapting and generating new types of interactions, creating away and allowing and encouraging pieces to go viral. this is the essence of the \#seedpack protocol. we are taking our idea from a one person one use monopoly and reimagining it from the perspective of a common institution, which will spread on its own merit, using the TEAM backbone

 

 

 

excellent. i love \#seedpack that seems like obviously 3? maybe? or 9=rhizomatic virulence? and yes \#guilds contain/are/generate \#protocols

still working on the details.. basically it makes sure that any material required to start up your TEAMEO in another TEAM cluster without you is available for viral/spread use

it seems like you already have a lot of the logic built in

 

Brian papersheepdog Cloud, \[02.02.16 22:38\]

to UNION itself

but then this might just be something you would address more internally to your protocols.. that others can freely copy your org and link up with you etc

**if you can plant it like a seed and it may multiply on its own without you.. then the structure is compliant**

although we have to sort of let go at that point.. we would still presumably be the freshest source of new development on the protocols.. but who knows maybe it will be totally swept away

I am not totally sure if all orgs work like this.. but I am trying to understand better what we are generating here with the orgs/projects/protocols. **It seems to me that the critical idea is that with any way we are relating with each other, we should be doing it as peers. so our creations should reflect that. our orgs should be common and open, or at least the designs to copycat should be. although curation of material and development may be done by somewhat central sources (the creator and other creators), the way that people should be interacting once they are using anything we create, should be as peers, on equal ground, with horizontal (do it if you can) access to the structures they create. Our projects may start off under old paradigms but they will eventually have to be upgraded with \#seedpack so they become part of a catalog of apps which any cluster of TEAM may choose from**
