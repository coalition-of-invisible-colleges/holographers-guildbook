\#rootseal declare any boundary of virtual space as the new reality with regards to the perspective of the observer, so that more general information can be assumed to be within the awareness of all participants, and need not be brought up when speaking naively.

 

In the Holographers' Guildbook we are going to sometimes assume materialistically that a cluster of individuals can be thought of as a state entity with centralized functionality, when in fact, the unique perspective of each individual in a network makes things much more complicated.

 

All words written here should not be directly executed but rather, interpreted first for alignment with the unique perspective of the individual to the spirit.

 

This also connects to another issue which is that in many cases we are forced to use centralized hierarchical type social media to connect with each other. The Tools need to be upgraded for use in a p2p network environment. So even though we may be pursuing certain centralized solutions, they are mere crutches on the way to doing the same in a network manner. This also may skew the wording and phrasings used support view of state entity and centralized functionality. We are aware of these and work to disintermediate and connect directly with Others.

Note that the best an author can ever do is try to convey an experience they had. The most difficult thing in life aside from going through difficult and traumatic experience is expressing what you have found through your journey of healing. There are so many approaches possible, bear in mind how difficult it must be to express.

In order to interact there has to be some common framework shared amongst peers. The Hidden Temple myth is an alignment tool used by CATS (Collection of Autonomous Transdimensional Sorcerers) to cooperate stigmergically. The Hidden Temple is conceptually separated into 3 lairs with the Body as the surface, the Bridge inward (outward), and the Heart as the center. These 3 lairs designate the different areas of focus for the protocols found within. Each lair depends on the lair below it to function.

 

The Body is limited to the individual, the Bridge is limited to connecting with Other individuals, and the Heart is the culture that emerges and flows as Spirited Matter (aka Omni). Guilds form the Heaven (spirit) bound and protocols the Earth (matter) bound. The human body (aka Hidden Temple) is what bridges this gap between Heaven and Earth making protocols function in the context of the guild/society.

 

Each individual maintains their own database of protocols called a \#deck. These protocols form holograms when shared and used amongst multiple individuals. Each individual contains a full \#stack of protocols to peer directly with Others. The \#deck can be thought of as a simple collection of the protocols that the individual is willing and able to use.

 

The \#stack is whats actually being used currently (online) amongst a \#cluster, seen from each individual perspective. One or more individuals sharing layer 2 and layer 3 protocols is called a \#cluster.

 

 

 

Here are three core protocols. They form a \#stack in which each lair depends on the one below. Each lair has its own perspective which we use to order protocols. Protocols are further sorted from Heaven (spirit) to Earth (matter) for each lair.

  Protocol Name               Lair          Description
  --------------------------- ------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \#application (\#checkin)   \(1) Body     Establishing capacity to navigate higher lair protocols. Application is a special first-time \#checkin.
  \#handshake                 \(2) Bridge   The peering protocol. Establishing a common stack of protocols. \#cluster to \#cluster convergence optimizations.
  \#seedpack                  \(3) Heart    Package cooperative holographic protocols for high memetic fluidity.

 

To clarify guilds and protocols with relation to heaven and earth. Protocols are created in the context of guilds. Guilds represent the higher spirit, the ideal of what is being captured to protocol matter. So within the human body, we can find or create exercise protocols and establish better fitness (Earth), and we can also become more enlightened and liberated with insight protocols (Heaven). This shows how the Body lair contains protocols of spiritual and material nature.

 

Guild material is spiritual material (Omni), so it will be found in the Heart lair. However, a fitness guild may be responsible for creating and sharing Body lair protocols for individual fitness. All protocols which have been \#seedpack'd for memetic fluidity are considered spirited matter (Omni) of the Heart (3), even though they may only function at lair 1 or 2 when executed.
