**Purpose:** This is the beginning of the process of asking someone to work with you on shared passions. A formal invitation is given to invite that person to an interview.

 

1.  **Values:** I'm working on a decentralized social networking activism project for a number of reasons. These are:

    a.  List your values from your own \#values protocol (you should have done this before beginning to do \#checkin interviews).

1.  **Ask:** Would you like to (save the world, help me fix something, get some help with your projects, join an activism network, etc.)?

2.  **Schedule:** (If they say yes) Great! Let's schedule a time to do your first \#checkin interview, where we will begin the process of showing you how we are working on solving all of these problems. Or, we can start now if you are free.

    a.  Schedule a time with them or continue with the interview.

    b.  Set a reminder or add the interview to your calendar, so you can't possibly miss or skip the interview. This is a crucial moment in encouraging a new recruit by starting off on the right foot, and presenting a reliable and caring image of yourself and the TEAM!
