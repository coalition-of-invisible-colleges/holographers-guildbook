**Would you be willing to do check-ins or initial entry interviews like this one with others? If everyone checked in with one other person in our local cluster every two weeks, everyone would be covered.**

 

**Purpose:** One person can't do all of the \#checkin and recruitment interviews for everyone else, because they can be very time-consuming because they are so personal. So, the entire point of \#seedpacking the \#checkin protocol is so that it can be distributed in the network. Anyone can do any module of the \#checkin for anyone else. This allows new people to be passed along the recruitment pipeline by several hands; it allows one person to do all of the \#checkins for one particular type of \#module, if necessary; and it allows the \#checkin to be split up over several different interviews in order to make it manageable and not brutally exhausting.

 

1.  The \#checkin protocol is basically a [boost network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9hEfR-cXc4), a phone tree spreading encouragement, accountability, and practical help throughout a social network.

2.  **Ask:** I have &lt;x&gt; people on my \#checkin list. Would you like to help me by taking some of them off my hands?

    a.  How many can you take?

    b.  (Some people you will want to retain but also give to your interviewee, so they have two check-in interviewers. There are many reasons to do this—maybe you are friends with the person, maybe they could use additional check-ins for encouragement, or maybe they would enjoy talking to and meeting your interviewee.)

1.  **Accountabilabuddy:** In the Registration page on the Applications tab, change the "Accountabilabuddy' column for each person whom you are assigning to your interviewee.

    a.  Delete yourself as their accountabilabuddy if you are handing them off completely.

    b.  Otherwise, decide on the order of their accountabilabuddies—who will be their primary \#checkin interviewer, and who will be their secondary or more specialized interviewer?

<!-- -->

1.  **Schedule:** When can you do your first \#checkin that you took on?

    a.  Send your check-ins a message before then to begin the scheduling process—ASAP so they are in the loop.

1.  Add them to the [\#checkin Lobby](http://telegram.me/TEAMlobby) and [Data Stream](https://telegram.me/joinchat/B0EyOkEBysZpbmTMOAhS0w) groups on Telegram.

    a.  The \#checkin Lobby is the landing pad for people interested in getting plugged into the TEAM. Please keep an eye here and, if you can, offer to take on interviews for new people.

    b.  The Data Stream group is a place to post updates which need to be distributed to all check-ins: guild formation updates, projects which need contributors, and other group-wide news to update our check-ins on.

<!-- -->

1.  **Followup:** I will follow up with you on your \#checkins during our next check-in next week.

 

**Upkeep instructions:** Review your shared \#stacks.
