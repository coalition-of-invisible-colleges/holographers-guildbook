Write down ideas you have for protocols and metaprotocols right away when you have them! Capture those great ideas as stub protocol pages (in this "Protocols not in current use yet" section) or just a name. Try to put these in public pages so they won't get lost amongst all your personal notes and documents, lost forever.

Not sure where the protocol specs are for this at the moment.

 

 

Checkin notes. The 3-cell formation is a neat kickstart, but when the network is more robust, there will be plenty of triggers for checking in with each other, and it will no longer be necessary to create arbitrary groups where none yet exist.

Peers agree to not take anything personally. Peers agree to not hold anything said once this card has been played against either peer. This card is a license to wild expression, and especially to subconsciously trigger automatic patterned behavior in the Other which may sometimes be perceived as becoming extremely socially offended. You now have a safe space for the duration of the game so that if any negative feelings are lingering due to these types of subconscious communications (which can be properly recognized with skilled awareness), the Peers may neutralize any negative lingering feelings from the encounter with the positive spirit of discovery and curiosity which accompanies this card at time of play.

Lair 2 Protocol \#speakinprotocols. depndencies \#impersonal. a special way of using language is taking place to form protocols between parties. since the point is to address all difficulties, perceived as negative emotions, between parties wishing to cooperate, the false ego is easily tripped by attempts to negotiate this. this is why \#impersonal (Lair 1 skill) protocol is a prerequisite. parties make statements back and forth to negotiate the bounds of a potential solution to a particular problem or need.

 

 

 

 

\#onprotocol - meta snippit thought clips about various topics. Releasing the author from the burden of providing much context at all, just a name/symbol reference. To help grow the glossary, the map in our shared namespace, points in the web of our collective awareness.

In order for multiple individuals to interact efficiently, they need to share protocols. This is often done subconsciously and constitutes culture. We acknowledge that other clusters will form their own ways of communicating. Articulating of The Protocols is a difficult task which requires the cooperation of multiple individuals. We have so far created a core set of protocols which may be more easily understood and utilized. Through expressing protocols, we are showing a material proof of our values, and can more easily understand Others.

 

The \#bootup protocol is filling a function of what we called the first \#handshake, or first \#checkin. It’s a special case where we need to fill in some core protocols which are used by everyone who uses the Protocols. As seen elsewhere in the open source paradigm, protocols tend to be abstracted to the simplest functioning pieces which work together. Usually, expression is very difficult, however, we have developed protocols to make understanding much smoother.

 

One of the first to convey is that we can try to agree and negotiate a shared \#glossary or \#namespace. This lets us come to terms on what words are important to us and how we use and define them. We prefix protocols with the \#hashtag sign. In creating a shared glossary we come to agreement on how to communicate ideas that are shared betwetween two different ontologies. Matching up equivalent representations between two systems is called syncreting.

 

In order to continue describing the Protocols, I am first going to introduce the \#hiddentemple protocol which is a conceptual framework for thinking about protocols. It divides protocols into one of 3 layers: \#thebody, \#thebridge, and \#theheart. The first layer includes protocols which are done by oneself, with the individual as the focus. The second layer includes protocols which deal with the mechanics of peering with an Other, the ability to connect and share protocols. The third layer includes protocols in which individuals holographically interact with their Other selves to accomplish tasks motivated by \#formofjoy and \#formofsuffering.

 

Using this framework we can say that \#bootup is a layer 1 protocol (\#thebody), where an individual has to load up a whole bunch of protocols and see if they got themselves an operating system or not. The \#bootup protocol might be something that we acknowledge during an initial \#checkin/\#handshake. The \#checkin and \#handshake protocols are basic relationship protocols and so can be classified as layer 2.

 

The \#org protocol is used during the first \#checkin. It makes sure that anyone joining the network has defined their own metaorganization. This makes our relationship to one another as explicitly peer based (horizontal/network). This is also the basis for having your own unique set of protocols which you use to interact with others.

 

The \#profile protocol is intended to help us to more efficiently get to know one another and work together. We each have unique things to bring, and we are all needed in different ways.

 

We use a system of \#guilds to articulate the motives for specific projects, which ultimately lead to the creation of the Protocols. \#guilds are motivated by \#formofjoy, and/or \#formofsuffering, and can nest within one another to refine the motives. The guilds are related to the high level social aspects and ideals of the spirit. They are the context in which we work together on material projects and articulation protocol matter.
