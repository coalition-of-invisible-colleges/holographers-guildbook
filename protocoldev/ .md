Brian made this group to test proliferation of similar groups. Clearly GECK is related to Blake's new group and also to Jack's group that he hasn't articulated yet. So we will need to find a way to coalesce these various groups under fewer tabs or we will get buried under tabs and acronyms (even more than already).

 

This is an interesting problem and I don't see a clear solution except to continue the dialogue and allow natural confluences and agreeances to form amongst the closely-aligned groups/people who share a concrete focus. Perhaps this itself could be part of the "open-source ecology" designed by opengeck researchers? If one introduces 10 new invasive species, and 2 or 3 of them are closely-related enough to interbreed, what happens?

 

Practically speaking, I think opengeck could be subordinated as a Project underneath Blake's new FFM org. "Project \#opengeck", research project to create open-sourced modular garden-of-eden creation kit, especially the core logic which allows the biological parts to be logically parsed out and combined together in combinations that work, depending on the environment (that is an EXTREMELY 6-relevant-energy application there, "the clockwork heart of magic", the basing of codification patterns within various contexts, and having to work out that eternal logic within time).
