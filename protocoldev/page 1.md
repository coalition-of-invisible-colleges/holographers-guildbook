The TEAM Protocols Document v0.5 is the only document you need to read to understand how to interact successful with Anders Aamodt. It is the minimum set of requirements to communicate in valid format—in grammar, this is called well-formed.

 

In order to read and understand the TEAM Protocols Document, it is necessary to create and write your own &lt;Organization Name Here&gt; Protocols Document and include in it a list of protocols by which you enjoy getting to know others.

 

The specific format this map takes is not important. For example, I have been using hashtags to title protocols, because the hashtag word format has becomea basic unit of memetic currency, a compressed, alphanumeric (punctuation is avoided and handled idiosyncratically) micro- or multiword expressing one particular concept and nucleus of activity. Sub-word agglutinative morphetics, poetics and linguismics define the scope, style, affect, and effect of hashtag (i.e., word) upon the listener/reader. Grammar and the shape of our minds and mouths constrain the usual jargon we use to certain territories of habitual endeavor—and there are also so many undiscovered starting points for the ways words could insert us into the map of a shared namespace which is our common network of meaning.

 

A Protocols Document is a meta-card which groups other cards together. Each person joining the system makes one Protocols Document containing as many protocol cards as they would like. You can get these from anywhere—you can make them up, copy them from others, or use any object such as a \#tomato. In other words, a hashtagged protocol is like a trading card. And contained on the card is whatever you want to be there.

 

This setup of a game defines a system of syncretization between individuals' values systems. This syncretization does not mean synchronization, centralization, or oppression of any kind but merely (\#)talking about things versus (\#)not talking about things. What the things are is up for debate—what the topic of any conversation is, is politics.

 

This concept occurs across contexts. DNA exchange. Currency. DVD boxes. Any time there are boxes with informational code inside, which exchange in a lateral economy, if the rules are balanced you can potentially get a lively exchange of good "ideas" such as evolutionary adaptations, richer currency, or the very best movies. This kind of exchange creates an evolutionary environment, which is both lauded and criticized as "neoliberalism" (I mean it's new and liberal right? What does liberal even mean exactly? Generous? Like liberal with gravy serving sizes? Is the gravy liberated?). We can find out if it's good or bad by trying it (science!).

 

One way you could look at this is as a commonplace book. If we fight them against each other, they evolve into an extremely high-quality personal Bible, which is distributed in authorship amongst the population (using digital and wetware software). Think of it as a quaker dharma, containing the fewest lines of code possible to solve this particular social problem. What particular problem that is is also up for debate and plural definition by agreement (to either mirror, host, host your own copy of, or host a rebranded copy of the original protocol digital microcontract). This allows anyone to participate in the process completely from the beginning, since the cards themselves are written (and must be coded) in a perspective which assumes that the other person may not already have the card. In other words, introductions are required, and these cannot be coded because when contacting an alien ontology you may not be able to communicate at first, and you have to trade shibboleths until you encounter a shared schema or starting point of relating. If anyone can say anything (26 letters to the power of the length of the word), who's to say what kinds of crazy things someone might *seem* to be saying when you first meet them? \#gtfo girrafe tribal function outreach, or maybe it means got pho?

 

By battling simply for the shortest best hashtags and protocols, interesting memetic duplications create ripple effects and shear interference effects which are productive of a new order of information. In other words, the system evolve a language and a meta-language of communicating about the language and about the decisionmaking process of the social body.

 

This is syncretization. Social competition over finding the best boxes (remember, the playing field is huge—so many possible words to whrite and dhefine) produces evolution of the stock (literal cardstock if we have them printed—the quality of the gold will increase, the card itself becomes invested with capital, both the individual physical card and all its copies as a single collated image—an idea, is invested with capital.)

 

And capital in this context simply works out to be attention, voluntary replication or voluntary attribution (of original authorship and chain of anyone who has modified the card/protocol since then—and these changes can be synced and merged decomposably blockchain as well (2D+ blockchain = Ceptr). It's a system which merges and syncs with itself in order to reframe itself in a way which can be &lt;understood, intelligibly, I guess&gt; by all (choose one, or write-in your own) (additional rules here).

 

This is decentralized politics.

 

So you can now copy my page and/or any of my protocol pages, or simply refer to them in this digital notebook, when you play the Game.

 

When you play a typing game, you can press any key next and you can produce any kind of output.

 

So. Unrelated. But I just googled "best way to keep notes backed up in Linux". Btw I like to put the punctuation after the quote marks, because the quote finishes before the sentence finishes, in my mind. "One does not simply walk into Mordor." It just floats there, hanging, disengaged from the forward-moving momentum of the sequentialization of the text. Enclosed in the quotes, the sentence itself recedes from the text, and becomes a virtual contribution to the paper in question. Someone else's words, the quote marks say.

 

I lied. The search was related. The best way to back up notes in Linux is almost definitely an exact model and minimalist implementation of the syncretization model described and proposed above. I don't use Linux and my internet is broken right now, so that is an hypothesis that I can verify later: That some of the most popular ways to store notes on Linux will follow a strict and austure trading-card-like pattern in the way that not only each file, but each *written character* in that file, and each *backed-up version* of that file over time are syncretized via the combined effect of versioning over time, you working on that small set of files to refine it and pare it down. This is a collective value, that of participating in this word-crafting practice to develop social customs in an egalitarian way, where anyone can participate, write, copy, modify, attribute, or choose to arbitrarily "rebrand" a card and drop the original author (by marking it as rebranded, you are simply claiming it's not original—that you got the idea from someone else, but you are not specifying who it was necessarily. ""). By making the information free and creating an environment where it is fun to write, trade, read, and "play" (i.e., do the thing written on) the cards, **a currency is formed which cannot be owned, taken, or devalude (arguably). The basic unit of a piece of paper that you trade around becomes colonized by the idea of drawing on them, scribbling on them, passing art around as a meta-micro-currency, and those variously-sized squares of paper ('cards') become the basis for a protocol construct of decentralized constitution authorship for a new decentralized global meta-nation**. (Aren't those words terrifying?) The fundamental nature of the card system or trade of DNA system is the magic circle, the ouroborous, which can appear on anything in our perception because it is the basic shape of a "thing" that our brain uses to pattern-match … things … to reality—and, it also occurs in the strangle \[sic\] loop of consciousness, from ana (I) to kata (you/body/world). The magic circle multiplies (2, doubling) and spreads out the circle into a complex field or network, a grid of circles or maybe a hex map or maybe a flower of life. These various patterns or possibilities of interlinkages is where we get the Mercurial qualities of Mercury, Hermes, the "one-grid" (iirc) as Marie-Louise von Franz called this fundamental Indra's Net or Web of interconnection between all things. The connection occurs through two ways: syncretization through the center (comparative collation and translation—a protocol is instructions for a translation); and proximity, overlap, or territorial dispute between the circles **as if they were territories.** Territories fighting in extended, and thus limited (finite) spaceis where we get the ideas of war, parasitism (software interfaces have a lot to do with this—or user interfaces in general, such as tarot cards or the buttons on then blender or the fact that a ball bounces). relating this version to that version in the future (causal/lineal)
