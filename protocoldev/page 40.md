A \#handshake protocol is a protocol for use between entities when there are no known shared protocols. This can occur at the level of individuals and between groups.

 

As groups and individuals change, they must continually resynchronize with each other through propagating changes to their personal glossaries throughout their local network. This can be thought of as ongoing or repeated \#handshakes.

 

A \#handshake takes the form of a query-response conversation in which each entity asks the other if they implement certain core protocols. When queried, an entity will search its glossary for an \*analogue\* of the protocol being requested, and reply with that. This is a process of coming-to-terms with each other.

 

The point of the \#handshake protocol is to bring two entities into holographic self-similarity, so that they either become stigmergic or discover that they already were.

 

**Steps for a single \#handshake (to synchronize a single protocol/glossary term)**

1.  Query the other entity as to whether they have a given glossary term or protocol. This can be an explicit question or simply using the jargon in speech, since it will be undefined to the new entity.

2.  They respond with the closest analogous match they can think of from their own glossary.

3.  Agree or disagree whether the suggested synonym is a close or true match or not.

    a.  If it is a true match, you are finished. You have syncretized a holon by performing a \#handshake.

    b.  If it isn't, continue the process of querying and negotiating meaning until an analogous concept is found. If the other entity appears not to have an analogous concept (glossary term or protocol), you may offer them yours by showing them your definition of your glossary term.

1.  Recursively complete these steps for all sub-protocols or dependencies in the glossary definition.

 

Overview

The \#hazing protocol has many hidden functions, but most importantly it prepares the individual to express common authority, and peer with others cooperatively. This can be thought of as a foundation onto which we build additional functionality. The \#handshake protocol puts this individual into the context of peer to peer communication.

 

A cluster happens when two or more peers are cooperating with at least one protocol in common. If two individuals each create a TEAMEO and exchange hazing protocols, then clustering has occurred. Each individual maintains a schema of protocols which they are aware of and willing to use in cooperation with others. A cluster is not a state, its just what we call it when many peers are connected with high schema convergence.

 

**\#handshake steps to schema convergence**

 

1.  Can peer offer \#hazing protocols to you? If NO, offer \#hazing protocols.

2.  Review and adopt protocols to the local schema as necessary for cooperation.
