\#crew protocols sign up to \#[teamearth](http://map.decente.red/)

 

By joining the \#crew, you will be directly contributing to development of the \#teamearth mythoscape magical nexus commons. This project is in its early stages, and needs inputs from as many people as possible. By using the system, you will be able to connect with other TEAMEOs, and the map will become more useful and complete. The map is not the territory. We make maps to accelerate convergence.

 

 

**\#crew protocols**

 

**1**. create a set of hashtags which center on the issues and ideas most important to you (a problem-solution/operations/worldview map). Try to find hashtags that speak to the highest essence and most critical leverage points available to your understanding. Add this hashtag cloud to your TEAM profile under \#mindmap.

 

**2**. Sign up to the mindomo mindmap website at <http://www.mindomo.com>. You can use a google account to log in. Create a new mind map. Begin with a central element titled \#teamearth \#profile &lt;username&gt; and increase the font to 30pt bold. Now create a sub-element and dump your hashtag list into it (these can be arranged/mapped later).

 

**3.** Sign up to the forum at <http://decente.red/forum> and contact Brian (papersheepdog) to have your account approved. Go to the [Cartography section](http://decente.red/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=15) under Library and create a new post titled with a hashtag that represents your TEAMEO.

 

**4**. establish a physical presence anchored to the \#teamearth mythoscape here <http://map.decente.red>. All TEAM \#crew are granted one residential class building (aoe2) in any city of their choice. This building can be moved at any time and signifies your current intentions to others. You may find that your hashtags from step one connect with existing concentrations of tags and will likely choose to park your TEAMEO HQ near by. See \#[criticalcartography](http://map.decente.red/criticalcartography/) for maps of the realm.

 

**5**. As an extension to the \#dossier protocol, you may wish to bring elements of the \#oeuvre, \#hupomnemata, or \#experience to your \#crew node established in the above step. Use the mind map created in step 2 to collect any information you would like to openly share with the network to increase interactivity. The balance between showcasing the TEAMEO or the individual is up to you. You may submit an image for the \#crew node page (815x596px).

 

**6**. the \#teamearth mythoscape website is currently a mockup which has to be manually edited. Once you have gathered your profile data and the links to your mind map and forum post, send this information to the realm admin (Brian) to have a card created and represented on the map.

 

 

**Having completed the above steps, you are now \#crew certified!** \#crew protocols establish an environment for interaction upon which further protocols may later depend. \#crew members have access to a forum to dump and draft large amounts of data together. \#crew members also have access to mind mapping software to help them bring order to themselves in connection with others. \#crew members also gain access to their own personal node on the \#transliminet in the realm of \#teamearth linking them into the horizontal namespace at [http://map.decente.red/&lt;hashtag&gt;](http://map.decente.red/%3chashtag%3e).

 

 

Next steps:

 

List and develop all aspects of your TEAMEO or other projects which can be worked on in common and spread as viral institutions. A hashtag should be assigned to each of these elements and then they can be planted, connected, to the \#teamearth mythoscape. Create and explore your own maps, or work to link and cooperate with others on common intersections (hashtags, archtypes, etc).

 

\#partytree is the realm lobby which should be used as a central connection point for community. We will use this node to map out the social media landscape of our network as well as a connection point for collaborative efforts and other local information. Check in often, create something new.
