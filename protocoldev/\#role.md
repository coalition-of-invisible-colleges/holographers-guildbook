This replaces the \#protoguild protocol. Instead of having so many repetitive tables, let's just have one guild registration table, and each registered guild member can have a "Role" column where they put down what type or angle of the root archetype they are—for example "guerilla librarian" as a role in the Librarians' Guild. And second, and "interest" column which could maybe include a note about that person's specific or angle of interest in the guild.
