To reduce your involvement in the TEAM, you can try to focus all your activity through the people who check *you* in. These people are your "lieutenants" because they will keep you updated on TEAM developments and request your help when you are needed, but otherwise leave you alone. Wouldn't it be nice if we could all go on vacation to the Bahamas and run our activist empire with an occasional phone call?

 

I repeat, your interviewees are not your lieutenant. Your *interviewers* are your lieutenants. This reverses the power structure associated with this term.
