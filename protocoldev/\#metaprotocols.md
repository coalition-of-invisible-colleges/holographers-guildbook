This page and its subpages are a workspace for how to discover, construct, write and format, and progagate protocos.

It also contains some loosely thrown together scrap and such which may skew ones views towards a certain set or constraints, expectations, a reality tunnel etc. Everything here is mostly just throwing ideas where they land and sort out the carnage afterwards when there is time. Exercise awareness and by all means create and discuss.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The first step is to discover what it is to make protocols. This is why there is a requirement for creation when joining "the TEAM." The \#hazing protocols of an organization simply introduce users to the structure, whatever it is, however complex. It can be a simple act which may generate insight, or a complex initiation process which shows you the tools and ways of the system.

 

Anyways. These protocols can be looked at as occurring on one stratum of interaction, whereas how they even came about could be said to be protocol behavior executing on a higher stratum. So we can actually make instructions for creating TEAMEO type orgs, and we can also get real meta. But that is up to each and their own level of interest. This is why the TEAM hologram is an open horizontal structure because it is possible to understand and interact with at any level, if you are able or willing.

 

Since we have established a list of potential categories for a system of guilds which are numerologically mapped, beginning at least with something similar to the zodiac, we can now quickly collect a large number of new and existing decentralized p2p type systems which comprise an open knowledge cybernetic society.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  i think we should avoid filling up the chart with anything but naturally/organically-growing TEAMEOs within our \#cluster. otherwise the chart will get muddled and useless.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

true.. but if they are high quality and originate from some sort of natural demand then it should be good

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  yeah if they are natural emergences, they work. brainstorming a bunch at once is usually a recipe for inorganic creation of them, though
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

 

In addition to iteration of these orgs, I may add some other \#metacols to this page, as well as development of the products of these. I will also give one example of a simpler protocol which may generate a lot of useful content. **\#popdecode** protocol { watch music video (or any popular work) on youtube and create a hashtag list with any critical topics that are exposed in the video, movie, etc. Add link and hashtag list to the forum page for \#popdecode. Meta: now watch for common hashtags and give them a home with links to all the examples. \#seedpack collect and share list. End protocol } now we have a list of useful hashtags and examples, sweet.

**\#guildbuild**

 

I wonder.. now that we have sort of established some vague idea of some of the guilds we have encountered, maybe we should have a go at just trying to fill in a whole bunch of generic orgs to accommodate various functions of society but with \#seedpack compliance, made as a TEAM app.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  this is a fun exercise but again, i think it will muddy the waters if taken too seriously. we should work from our personal inspiration and situations, and not attempt to generalize for the world or for others outside the current TEA
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

 

*Since I put all of the yellow caution stuff on this page, I will clarify my intentions. I personally have a backlogged queue of orders and geometries waiting for expression and I have already investigated many facets of society. This is the reason that I will likely be able to produce a fair number of high quality and critical path type orgs. What I am also doing here is trying to standardize the protocol process a bit to allow others to understand and participate more easily.*
