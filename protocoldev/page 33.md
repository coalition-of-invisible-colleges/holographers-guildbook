The \#curriculum protocol solves the problem of recommending a shit ton of books, movies, TV shows, and other media to each other and not being able to track or follow up on any of it. It also solves the problem of people throwing way too many links, videos, and other media at you and not being able to limit that incoming flow or prioritize a viewing/reading list.

 

The \#curriculum protocol consists of a list where people can leave recommendations of media to consume (read, watch, click, play, etc.). It's very similar to the \#assignme protocol, but focused on non-vital work, i.e., the consumption of media.

 

\#curriculum is technically a many-to-many protocol because ideally, you would be on a post-Facebook social network and be able to navigate to any friend and see your curriculum to and from that friend. So, a \#curriculum list can be implemented in either direction by any two individuals. But, here in this notebook, we implement it as a one-page inbox for each person due to technology constraints.

 

When we have shared experiences, we move closer to others. The \#curriculum protocol allows us to organize our media-viewing/reading activity based upon the urgency and interest of others, and upon our own desire to prioritize certain media based on our interest or who recommended it.

 

(Ideally, a composite viewing list could be automatically compiled from all your \#curricula by a post-Facebook social networking application which would most efficiently move you in the social-ideological direction you wanted.)

post-facebook social networking app + \#curriculum protocol = the total end of information overload

the endgame would be that you could vote/bump up your suggestions on your friend's lists with tokens (metacurrency)—if this were capitalized, that would mean that some people who a bunch of people want to read things could become professional readers and get paid for it. but just the token economy would be nice because you could use it to tell your friend "this is reaaally important i want you to read it now!" in a way the computer understands
