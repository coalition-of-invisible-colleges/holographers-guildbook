Overview

 

First, \#hazing provided the individual TEAM operating environment. Then, \#handshake allowed for protocols to be shared on a p2p basis. \#guildbook stacks on top of this infrastructure creating societies that address common problems. The guilds emerge from specific protocol action and collate numogrammatically to the general ArchGuilds of society.

 

Guilds are not organizations, they are not owned by individuals, they do not belong to anyone. Guilds are RELATIONSHIPS amongst individuals. A body-without-organs (BwO) for a rhizomatic group with a specific shared intent.

 

A guild is a protocol which describes some specific suffering, and a primary project or approach of the guild in its work to address it. Guilds can be nested to better organize protocols. The \#guildbook contains the guild overview, a member list (TEAMEO), and a library of all protocols under shared use and development by the guild. Sharing of updates is a logistical issue, either a \#handshake repeatedly occurs, or there is a centralized book (such as onenote).

 

Multiple guilds can exist amongst the same group of people, overlapping and allowing them to cleave off functions individually. But avoid having more guilds than is absolutely necessary, as this will cause some guilds to become sidelined in favor of more central ones. And I don't think it will make sense at all if there are more guilds than there are people in the group (degrees of freedom, n-1).

 

**\#guildbook steps to guild formation**

 

1.  Create a one page description for the guild including the name, the form of suffering it's intended to ameliorate or prevent, the primary project or approach, and next actions.

2.  Find a peer who is willing to adopt the guild into their schema and to use and develop protocols within its context.

3.  Collect the guild protocol page, along with all further protocols into a single book which is shared among the guild. This book can be thought of as separate, but it nests into the Book of TEAMEO schema as a sub book.
