The Protocols do not function by authority—they function because they are totally and perfectly reasonable **if you actually read them.**

 

So please read them and witness the beautiful memetic blockchain work that has been done by your predecessors. If you would like to change the system, discuss and debate the protocols and suggest or simply make the changes/edits you would like to make.

 

If you don't read the protocols and then try to define a new system, that is not Protocol-based work, it is just an attempt to create boundaries and definitions which can be applied universally to third parties who are not currently present.

 

Protocols must be read and the entire dependency stack (the protocols a protocol refers to) must be read and correctly ordered (in a semantic tree) before the whole situation for that protocol will make sense. If any one protocol is missing from your reading, you might think there is a problem with the system, when it is really some specific information or idea which you are missing which is causing you to create a solution to problems which have already been well-solved.
