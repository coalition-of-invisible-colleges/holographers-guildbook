*"I was thinking that we send a member they send a member and then those two talk about the differences and mythos of each group and be the bridge. Going back and telling their 'home' group what the other is about more fully."*

—David Pearson

 

*"I agree that an ambassador would be useful BUT keep in mind that this is making a state out of the two groups.. as if you can just make a link and converge everyone through these ambassadors. This is not the case. Even a cluster is not fully converged.. you have some people who never talked to each other.. it ALL comes down to the \#handshake of each pair*

 

*but for the initial contact.. ambassadors could be really helpful for first impressions and such*

 

*Like if we were going to converge with a corporation of 20 people.. the ambassador may be all we need.. cause we will not be able to peer with the worker drones anyhow. If we were to actually attempt convergence it would be like cherry picking people out of the group who are able to peer as individuals.. it would be totally parallel to the hierarchy*

 

*so conversely, we are not such a group that can have a single ambassador.. cause we are a cluster of individuals. we are each the ambassador to our self*

 

*unless we are taking great care"*
