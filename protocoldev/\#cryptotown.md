Cryptotown

Open Knowledge Cybernetic Society

 

This is a network for connecting global wisdom to local action.

 

It originally started as a way to link cryptocurrency adoption efforts on the ground with a network of deveopers and engineers to holistically approach the cultural transition foretold by the rise of the blockchain, and by the many cities lost before it.

 

Two physical manifestations were envisioned: the **\#cryptomall**, and the **\#cyberneticsclub**. The cryptomall is a collection point for crypto businesses and enthusiasts to find and support each other. It would include a local fiat exchange and directory services, as well as on-site consultancy services for using alternative currencies, and favoring local cooperation over importation. A cybernetics club is like a club of clubs, a virtual or meta club for accelerating connected convergence. It may discuss strategies for increasing membership of local groups or creating new ones to meet demand. All cryptotown institutions work to benefit the commons in open collaboration.

 

\#coinopts is the vanguard of this movement—a group of saboteurs who wyrd their hometowns using a convenient franchisable package of weirdness installations. —Anders
