\#headquarters is where this instantiation of the guild is centered, within this local cluster. Any centralized locations or sources of information become the headquarters. For example, you will probably want to list a primary Telegram channel as the main headquarters, and also mention your guild's OneNote tab or any other shared documents you are using regularly.

 

Second definition: \#subguilds are guilds that have recursively collated as per the \#guild protocol.
