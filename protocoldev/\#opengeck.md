GECK = Garden of Eden Creation Kult (virtual/common institution)

 

Working on components of openGECK, the open-source Garden of Eden Creation Kit.

 

mission statement: viral abundance, open source ecology. Many projects exist already which have been working in this area. They can all be considered part of the work of openGECK. The GECK has two major components. The first component is an open-source self-replicating (3d printed) ecological architecture and infrastructure technology. The second component, which all too often goes missing and blows the whole thing up killing everyone horribly the first use, is the ever critical inner technologies which activate the ancient circuitry, allowing full human flowering and universal healing to proceed. Without this connection, the beings are succeptible to fear and division, isolated by their exclusively competitive worldview.

 

So far this is just a collection of projects with potential to become components of an openGECK. Such as reprap I think.. A 3d printer that 3d prints itself.. That’s important to accelerate production. And Open Source Ecology.. Which is making open source specs for farm tools.. But it’s a lot of industrial type tech which maybe isnt going to be the way to go. I see 3d printerd greenhouse and vertical farm structure/tech/components as interesting ideas.
