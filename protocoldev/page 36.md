Overview

 

\#hazing provided the individual TEAM operating environment. \#handshake allows for protocols to be shared on a p2p basis. The \#guildbook (guild) collects protocols to address common problems as a society (social media). \#seedpack is the creation of holographic protocols, such as \#hazing, \#handshake, and \#guildbook.

 

Society is a collection of agreements for behavior that we will call protocols. We will create and use protocols to address specific problem domains of suffering. Guilds will emerge bearing collections of these protocols and connecting peers in a decentralized manner to a full spectrum protocol stack.

 

Cooperative society will compete with competitive society to solve artificial scarcities and meet basic needs. There may always be markets, but most of them can be destroyed by local abundance. The cooperative hologram refers to free and open structures captained by equal peers. This is in contrast to opaque hierarchical structures which form on the basis of private competition and subservience. (these issues may be cleared at higher layers).

 

TEAM confirms the natural authority within each of us to relate to each other as creative peers. With this basic environment we may now lay out the framework for our societies.

 

Most \#hazings result in a TEAMEO which is not ready to operate in this environment. The TEAMEO has focused on the individual conditions. Now the sorcerer must upgrade these protocols into self-replicating peernet applications. e.g., A personal quest to start local community gardens becomes a guide on how anyone can launch local community gardens!
