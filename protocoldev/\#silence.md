Only TEAM members handle the \#protocols. This is a code of silence because:

 

1.  The protocols must be read in order to be understood.

2.  The protocols MUST be read in order to be understood!

3.  The protocols must be read in order, in order to be understood!!!

4.  The protocols confuse and derecruit outsiders.

5.  It is nice to present a human face to others.

 

We don't need to currently use/distribute this protocol because we have set up the interview and check-in process such that it is already followed. In other words, the \#silence protocol is already silent.
