Restoring Food Sanity: subsidize farmers' markets by matching all money spent there by the public 100% up to \$20 per week per person, adjusted for inflation and locality

Â 

This will dramatically increase farmers' market popularity, it will strongly promote good health and local healthy food and farming, and it would basically solve most of the food politics problems (for half the year...) if it were widely implemented

i am on food stamps and my county has a program like this. they will match up to \$10 a week when i buy tokens with my food card, so if i go to the farmer's market, instead of it being bourgie absurd prices that everyone somehow pretends are low, it is actually priced reasonably and cheaper than the grocery store for MUCH better produce. i was shocked today at the quality, i asked, not as a localist fetish but just because i was in a state of wonder at how beautiful the produce was, "Where was this grown?"
