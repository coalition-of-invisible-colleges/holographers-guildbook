i think it's more straightforward—suffering due to not having enough food, having poisoned or low-quality or inappropriate food of not enough variety, suffering due to having to pay too much for food, suffering due to being manipulated politically in relation to food or in order to get food, suffering due to not having ownership of one's own food supply chain
