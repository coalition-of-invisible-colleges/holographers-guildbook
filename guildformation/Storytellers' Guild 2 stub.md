Potential guild—not yet officially formed yet

 

Storytellers' Guild is the initiatic arm (almost a subset of shamanism)

 

Suffering due to not telling your story, not being encourage to tell your story, not having an audience or a careful listener to whom to relate and develop your story. Also suffering due to not having heard good or well-told stories, being assaulted with too many low-quality spectacle stories, and not having any refuge of high-quality media or community of storytellers to turn to.

 

The Storytellers' Guild is a group of interactive media magicians bent on taking back the pleroma and the basic interactivity of having a conversation with someone again. Programming is itself the removal of decision points in the process of making a story, of speaking, and turns elocution from an activity into a rote process that follows typical patterns of story and reality construction. Storytellers are those who attempt to bend and break the rules of narrative normality, in order to create new or distinctively appropriate stories for their place and time in history. The idea that all stories have already been written or that traditional stories hold a higher value than telling a story that is original or unknown, is fascistic in its yoking of the future present to the past. Storytellers practice the craft of story-telling, the art of consciously manipulating the crux of enunciation in order to enrapture the listener.
