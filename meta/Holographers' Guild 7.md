  **\#overview**          One of the most fundamental guilds of the TEAM, the Holographers' Guild discovers, articulates, develops, and refines the protocols which underlie the stigmergic functioning of the blockchain illuminati.
                          
                           
                          
                          Holographers bring noncommunicative opposites into communication with each other, bridging schisms or prejudicial divides in communication through the formulation and discovery of new protocols which offer meta-perspectival views to all who adopt them. In this capacity, hologragraphers act as social alchemists.

\#bootstrap

\#bootstrap protocol takes an information technology metaphor and applies it to the human body. At its most basic level it seeks to reformat the operating system starting with low level hardware operations. The material takes the form of creative expression, and many different versions and sources may appear, such as select pieces of our vast cultural heritage in film and music (see Meta-Religion tab).

 

An operating system involves many layers of complexity, but it comes down to its components which each do their own part. There are two main categories of protocol for the body, aka, the Hidden Temple: hierarchical and network. Some protocols involve asymmetrical relationships between individuals such as boss/employee or client/server or state/citizen. These protocols are the result of private hierarchical organization

 

\~

 

The following is writings I have created to make the Hidden Temple myth more accessible. There is more material in the Protocol Development tab called \#stack, which goes into more detail, and loosely crosses the mythic threshold.

 

\~

 

I am going to try to give context and details which will enable Others to quickly understand the network.

 

The first note about this work is that its intended audience is those who already have gone through their own self awareness and discovery process and succeeded in gaining the perspective necessary to understand most of the writing contained here with little or no explanation.

 

The network is based on individuals who peer with each other.

 

Each individual has their own experience and values and navigates the network from their own subjective coordinates.

 

By creating agreements which operate in an open, peer to peer fashion, individuals can cooperate directly with one another to their maximum mutual benefit, without the need for third party mediation by private (opaque) hierarchies.

 

The network society is where we look to for answers to competitive domination and alienation by our secretive and materialistic systems of ego. Our answer to wonton destruction, waste, and artificial scarcity is simply abundance. There is no need to oppose anything which will collapse in the face of abundance.

 

Markets are destroyed in areas of plenty; they cannot exist. There will always be markets for things, and its ok, but we will pick all the low hanging fruit to re-establish sovereignty to all who will accept some responsibility for their existence.

 

Other reasons.

 

The network is composed of individuals. In order for an individual to properly interact with the network, they must express certain traits and behaviors which can easily be recognized by other individuals in the network.

 

This sets the stage for our first layer of protocols which deal with the individual (body). These include personal routines and behavior patterns that enable the individual to function in the world, to exist, in order to interact with others, as well as the specific higher spirit alignments which allow for self-management within the social functions.

 

Each individual can act as a node on a number of different networks which are governed by protocols. These protocols are social agreements for how to do work in the context of open cooperation amongst peers.

 

When multiple individuals share social media and interact with each other using The Protocols we call this a cluster. The purpose of clustering is convergence and agreement on the best protocols amongst each collection of individuals. It is also a necessary nucleation simply for agreement on which social media will be used to interact with Others.

 

Each individual is aware of those protocols which they have encountered and shared with others and therefore possesses a collection of protocols which are unique to their subjective coordinates. It is up to each pair of individuals to negotiate which protocols they would like to cooperate upon.

 

When multiple individuals wish to come to agreement on protocols they will form a common namespace for the symbols which they will use to communicate with one another. This can simply be done by hashtagging a unique string of words and letters which can represent the idea in a memorable way. Some words can simply be capitalized to identify an additional shared understanding.

 

TEAM has existed as a collection of open protocols. Work on the latest protocols includes a \#deck protocol for a card trading system to express and share cultural values and methods. Sharing a namespace for these cards means that no two protocols can have the same name, and if conflicts arise, refinements and distinctions will be negotiated to map the contours of the networks function.

 

The \#deck, or some similar responsibility for representing one's abilities and willingness, is necessary for interaction amongst peers in a network. It is a list of the Protocols which the individual is aware of or willing to use to interact with Others. This is a second layer protocol related to \#handshake, which negotiates a \#stack of active protocols amongst peers.

 

We have encountered two layers so far and will now include the third layer of this conceptual framework. The first layer is for protocols involving one self. The second layer protocols are for contact between two peers. The third layer is for protocols which involve many individuals, interacting with their Other selves to form a cultural hologram.

 

Open cooperative networks look like a hologram in that each individual is running the similar protocols with a fully responsible \#stack to the tasks at hand. Self ownership does not happen without positioning oneself for responsibility (ability to respond). Spiritual liberation is at the core of the holographic nature of illuminati networking. Experience of spiritual awareness is what allows us all to work together as a team without material command.

 

 

 

 

 

The objective for each individual is to disintermediate as much as possible, reduce imports and expenses

 

 

which we call the Hidden Temple.

Overview

The Holographers' Guild, because it is obsessed with interlinking, perfection-vectored Protocols, and constant improvement and expansion, must necessarily also be organized and capable of refactoring and reorganizing existing structures non-combatively.

 

The Holographers' Guild is obsessed with linking everything together, at each scale. So, the Holographers' Guild is interested in linking together individuals with individuals, groups with groups, and meta-groups with meta-groups, to form one big transcalar rhizome for great justice.

 

The guilds themselves are an outgrowth of the drive to organize, cluster, and recluster until things "fit right". Guilds are convenient because they are not organizations; they are coalescences or temporary alliances of individuals under a shared banner or obvious shared purpose or manner of doing things. So, they are more about fit and pragmatics than they are about shared ideals or a deeply-held camaraderie. Because of this structure, they are relatively easy to mash up and remix when things need a change. And, perhaps more importantly, they are easy to apply conceptually to other groups, to see what their "role" is or could be in relation to our local TEAM cluster and the TEAMetanarrative as a whole. By "guilding" new clusters we run into—that is, by slicing them conceptually and syncreting them with our guilds—we find common ground and can connect the right people to the right people laterally across groups.

 

Syncretism—that's kinda the bottom line for the Holographers' Guild, perhaps.
